# QAInternship-Codemi
During my work experience as a Quality Assurance Automation Intern, I gained valuable hands-on experience in software testing and automation. My responsibilities included developing test plans, test cases, and test scripts, conducting both manual and automated testing, identifying defects, and collaborating with other interns and developers. With a passion for software testing and strong problem-solving and analytical skills, I was able to excel in this role. I also had a good understanding of software testing concepts and methodologies, along with familiarity in programming languages such as Python and Selenium.
